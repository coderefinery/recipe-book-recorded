How to make harira: Step-by-Step

Spices:
Ground turmeric
Ground cumin
Ground ginger
Ground cinnamon
Ground black pepper
Pinch of Cayenne (Tip: you can skip the cayenne and stir in a little bit of homemade harissa paste. It's next level delicious!)

Cook onions, celery, and carrots
Garb a large pot or Dutch oven (this is the one I use) and cook up the chopped onions, celery and carrots in a bit of extra virgin olive oil until softened a bit (about 5 minutes). Season with kosher salt and add the garlic and spices and cook another minute or so (your kitchen will smell amazing)

Add the tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas
At this point, add in the tomatoes (crushed tomatoes from a can), tomato paste (this really amps up the flavor and gives the soup some good color), both green and red lentils, and drained chickpeas (I used chickpeas from a can). Add the chopped cilantro, and if you do end up using some harissa paste, this is where you stir it in. Add a pinch of kosher salt and give everything a good stir to combine.

Add the liquid and cook
You can use low sodium vegetable or chicken stock (7 cups, or more if you like it more brothy). Bring the soup to a boil, then turn the heat to low and cover and let simmer until the lentils are fully cooked and very tender (about 45 minutes). Make sure to check the soup occasionally to adjust the liquid; it will get thick but you want to make sure you can still pour it (plan to add a little bit of water or more stock and adjust the salt as needed).
At this point, stir in the rice (or broken vermicelli) and cook another 15 minutes.
Serve with Lemon Wedges
Don't underestimate that fresh squeeze of lemon to wake all the earthy and deep flavors in this soup up! Cut up one or two lemons into wedges and have those available next to the soup.

You don't need much else to serve next to this hearty soup, but a little warm pita bread won't hurt.
